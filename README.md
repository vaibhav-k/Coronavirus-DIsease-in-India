# Coronavirus-Disease-in-India
Analysis of some of the data available online relating to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020. Although most of the data was sourced from different sources online, https://www.covid19india.org/ and https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset were the two main sources. I wish to be able to glean some trends from the data in order to help the fight against this pandemic.

If anyone wants to collaborate with me on this project, please contact me. Help with data collection or data analysis is welcome.
